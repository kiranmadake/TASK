               <h2><i> Who is the Father of Indian Navy Study Notes: Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj is called the father of the Indian Navy. The reason why the great Maratha Emperor is given this title is because of his contribution to the formation of the Naval Wing of the armed forces during the medieval period in India. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj not only realized the need for the naval wing but also constructed a number of naval bases along the coast. Chhatrapati Shivaji Maharaj created a number of fleets that ran under the leadership of notable Maratha leaders which kept the Dutch and English away from the coast for a significant period until 1729.
